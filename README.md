# Osz song exporter
A simple utility for exporting all songs and beatmaps (in .osz form) with a single click from your osu! library.

I find it funny that most of these utility software I found in Github either don't work or lacking in features. So I decided to make one myself!
## Disclaimer
This program only copies, and depending on the settings made by the user, converts and modifies the ID3 tags of songs that are already stored the user's (The individual operating this program) computer. The copied and/or modified files are stored in the user's device only. These songs are intended for personal use only and can be manipulated by the user in any way they wish. The author of this program cannot prevent the user from performing any copyright infringing actions with the files produced by the program. Therefore, in no event shall the author be liable for any copyright infringement claims. The user should only use these files under the confines of copyright laws.

This program, although requires the rhythm game "Osu!" to function, it is not affiliated with the person/company developed the game.

In short,

Do not use this program for distributing songs illegally. The creator of this program is not responsible for such actions performed by the user of the program. 
## Features
* Export all beatmaps as .osz or just the songs
* Proper file renaming (or rename it after beatmap ID if you really want to)
* Adding MP3 tags based on beatmap info
* Filters!
    * Practice songs
    * By song length (Skip any ~60 second farm maps. Unless you really like hearing haitai)
    * Similar songs with the same names to prevent duplicates (Extremely useful for saving space and if you have a large amount of beatmaps) 
* Conversion from ogg to mp3 (Conversion is done via FFmpeg, included in the program)
* osu library synchronisation if you frequently update your song library

The above features are fully configurable!
## Compiling
Just compile it with Intellij. That's it.

## Download
Go to the [release](https://github.com/ringosham/Osu-Exporter/releases) tab.

## Things to note
Depending on how many beatmaps you have, the process may take from less than 30 seconds to more than 5 minutes.

This program is only tested in Windows 64-bit, but it should work on all Linux distributions.

It is **NOT** compatible with macOS.

The FFmpeg binary is only 32-bit in Linux. Please make sure you have the dependencies for 32-bit compatibility.
