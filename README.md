##Features
* Proper file renaming
* Adding MP3 tags based on beatmap info
* Filter practice songs
* **Filter any similar songs with the same names to prevent duplicates** (Extremely useful for saving space and if you have a large amount of beatmaps) 
* Conversion from ogg to mp3
* Fixing encoding to old mp3 tags (Very old mp3s don't use UTF-8, which is the song shows up as "????" in your music player)

The above features are fully configurable!
